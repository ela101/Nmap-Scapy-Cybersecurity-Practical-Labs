# Nmap-Scapy-Cybersecurity-Practical-Labs

This repository contains the complete documentation and replication of the Nmap and Scapy hands-on labs taught during our cybersecurity practical sessions. The project demonstrates essential penetration testing techniques such as host discovery, service detection, OS fingerprinting, SMB enumeration, packet crafting, and protocol analysis.

## Objectives
- Reproduce all Nmap scans practiced during class  
- Recreate all Scapy sniffing and packet manipulation exercises  
- Document results with clear summaries, screenshots, and commands  
- Maintain a clean, professional, and easy-to-follow lab repository
